# üîß 5-Stage Pipelined Processor in Verilog

This project implements a **5-stage pipelined processor** in Verilog with **instruction-level parallelism**, **RAW hazard resolution using operand forwarding**, **branch handling with flush**, and support for **memory operations** like `LW` and `SW`. The pipeline supports a subset of MIPS-like instructions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Pipeline Structure

The pipeline is composed of five stages:

1. **Instruction Fetch (IF)** ‚Äì Reads instruction from memory.
2. **Instruction Decode (ID)** ‚Äì Decodes instruction and reads registers.
3. **Execute (EX)** ‚Äì Performs ALU operation, branch decision, effective address calc.
4. **Memory Access (MEM)** ‚Äì Accesses data memory if needed.
5. **Write Back (WB)** ‚Äì Writes result back to register file.

## ‚ö†Ô∏èData Hazard Handling

- **RAW (Read After Write)** hazard resolution using **Operand Forwarding**


 ---
## üö¶ Control Hazard Handling

- Branch instructions (`BEQZ`, `BNEQZ`) are resolved in the Execute stage.
- If a branch is taken:
  - PC is updated to branch target
  - The next instruction is **flushed** before entering Decode stage

## üß™ verififcation

Carefully designed test program to verify every functionality.
The testbench initializes registers and memory and then runs a complete instruction sequence .

### üßæ Program Flow

| PC  | Instruction                | Purpose                                     |
|-----|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|

| 2   | `ADD R3, R1, R2`          | R3 = R1 + R2 = 15                           |

| 7   | `ADDI R4, R0, 0`          | R4 = 0                                      |
| 8   | `BEQZ R4, 2`              | Skip next 2 instructions                    |
| 11  | `ADDI R2, R0, 111`        | R2 = 111                                    |
| 12  | `BNEQZ R2, 2`             | Skip next 2 instructions                    |
| 15  | `ADDI R3, R0, 123`        | R3 = 123                                    |

## üí° Design Challenges & Solutions

### üîç Struggles

- Initial incorrect data due to RAW hazards
- Unintended execution of post-branch instructions
- Write-back not completing before HALT

### ‚úî Solutions

- Used **Operand Forwarding** between EX and MEM stages
- Modified HALT logic to allow the last instruction to **write back**
- Introduced **FLUSH logic** on branches to clear wrong-path instructions

## üìò Future Improvements

- Implement `LW ‚Üí RR` stall logic for complete hazard support
- Add `JUMP`, `NOP`, and `JAL` instructions
- Add pipeline visualizer or instruction tracer
- Design assembler to convert MIPS-like assembly to binary
